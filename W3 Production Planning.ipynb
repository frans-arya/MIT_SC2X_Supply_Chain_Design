Not only would this tie up capital, it would also lead to a high risk obsolescence due to the rough handling in the warehouse. However, splitting up the order into several batches is also costly. For every batch they make there will be an initial setup cost due to equipment changeover and scrap from the \"burn-in\" period when the equipment is being fine-tuned.\n",

If the windows are shipped within the same month, they do not incur any holding costs, but for future periods they do. Custom Glass can easily produce all windows in a day, so capacity is not an issue.

The same seal (about the size of a coin) is used in multiple finished goods, such as necklaces, tie pins, cufflinks, and paperweights. The Coop is considering introducing in 2018 a new line of products featuring MIT's seal cast in 18 karat gold. These seals would be used in upscale jewelry, and as an ornament in the diploma frames that sell especially during commencement season.\n",

Because of this, Seventh Seal will charge The Coop a set-up cost of 1026.0dollars every time the MIT seal is produced.\n",
