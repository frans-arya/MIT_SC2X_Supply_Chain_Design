    "GoClean&Co (GCC) hired you as its Logistics Manager in charge of transshipments. GoClean&Co is a joint public-private energy company dedicated to generating clean and safe nuclear energy. GCC uses a new technology based on radioactive pellets. These pellets can generate electricity for years in GCC's nuclear plants. Once the radioactive pellets are depleted, they are removed from active use and collected at the plants for removal at the end of the month. Once a month, the depleted pellets are removed from the plants, transported to an inspection site for examination, and then moved again to a dedicated storage site for safekeeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been informed that two of GCC's nuclear plants, called Plant One and Plant Two, need to move out depleted pellets in the following amounts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Plant One wants to ship out up to 280 pellets per month\n",
    "\n",
    "Plant Two wants to ship out up to 360 pellets per month\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how many pellets these two plants want to ship out per month. However, the exact number of pellets that will actually be moved out from each plant depends on the space that is available at the dedicated storage sites that would ultimately receive them. GCC is mandated by law to move as many pellets out of the plants as the storage sites are able to receive. You have been informed that two of GCC's dedicated storage sites, called Storage X and Storage Y, are ready to receive depleted pellets from GCC's plants, in the following amounts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Storage X is ready to receive a total of 305 pellets per month\n",
    "\n",
    "Storage Y is ready to receive a total of 325 pellets per month\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the two plants want to ship out more pellets per month than the two storage sites can receive, you know that some pellets will have to stay in their plant of origin until a later time. This is not a problem, however, since every one of GCC's plants has the capacity to temporarily store whatever pellets are not shipped out, and the law allows this.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this time, only one inspection site is available to receive the pellets from the two plants, inspect them, and send them out to the two storage sites. It is called Inspection Site A. Notice that inspection sites do not have storage capacity: the pellets come in, are inspected, and continue their trip to the storage sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving radioactive material is not easy and therefore it is not cheap either. There is a lot of planning and security involved. Each shipment of pellets has to be closely monitored and protected to prevent the loss of radioactive material. Also, the vehicles transporting the material have to move relatively slowly, to avoid accidents. Therefore, it is very expensive to transport the radioactive pellets from the plant to the inspection site, and from there to the storage site. Based on estimates and historical data, GCC has calculated the following transportation costs, in dollars per pellet moved:\n",
    "\n",
    "It costs 13.58 dollars to move one pellet from Plant One to Inspection Site A\n",
    "\n",
    "It costs 16.54 dollars to move one pellet from Plant Two to Inspection Site A\n",
    "\n",
    "It costs 7.57 dollars to move one pellet from Inspection Site A to Storage X\n",
    "\n",
    "It costs 16.46 dollars to move one pellet from Inspection Site A to Storage Y\n",
    "\n",
    "You decide to optimize the transhipment of depleted pellets from the plants to the storage sites (stopping on the way at Inspection Site A, of course) in order to minimize the overall monthly transportation cost. In this optimized solution, how many pellets will Plant Two be able to ship out to the Inspection Site A every month? (This question is not graded)."

    "You decide to estimate the distance of distributing the notebooks from a DC in one of a set of selected cities to the school children in another city. Given that you only need a quick and dirty estimate, you assume an Euclidean space and a circuity factor of 1.25, which gives you the distances in the table below (where cities are identified using the first three letters in their name). Regardless of which city the DC is located in, there will also be transportation from the DC to the school children within that same city. For distances inside each city, you assume 5 distance units, except for Mexico City, for which you use 10 distance units since it is a larger city.\n",

The plan would be to distribute all the hundreds of thousands of notebooks through these two DCs, using trucks. Let's assume that the cost of opening and operating such a DC in any of these cities would be the about the same, and that the cost of outbound transportation from the DC to the cities is about the same on a per unit per mile basis.\n",

    "Since the manufacturing plant is operating close to its capacity of 1,250 thousand cups per week, Cocup has started to investigate whether they should use a contract manufacturer, now that the demand for their products is increasing. They have found one contract manufacturer that meets their requirements. This contractor can provide the cups at 50dollars per thousand cups and has the capacity to provide 200 thousand cups per week. This is more expensive than the 10dollars per thousand cups of producing in-house, but because the contractor is located closer to the two DCs than Cocup's plant is, it will lead to more production capacity closer to the DCs.\n",

Cocup has one (1) manufacturing plant and two (2) Distribution Centers (DCs), as well as eight (8) regional sales offices (SOs) with warehouses on site. Paper cups are made at the plant and shipped by external carriers through the DCs to the sales offices.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may remember, the manufacturing plant is operating close to its capacity of 1,250 thousand cups per week. Because of this, Cocup has started to investigate if they should use a contract manufacturer. They have found one contract manufacturer that met their requirements. This contractor can provide the cups at 50dollar per thousand cups and has the capacity to provide 200 thousand cups per week. This is more expensive than the 10dollar per thousand cups of producing in-house, but because the contractor is located closer to the two DCs than Cocup's plant is, it will lead to more production capacity closer to the DCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cocup has also started to investigate whether they should rent space from a third party's distribution center to support the sales offices. They are considering three (3) more DCs, to add to the two (2) DCs they already have in their network. Transportation costs are 1$ per thousand cups and mile, for both inbound and outbound transportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may remember, the logistics manager of Cocup was skeptical about the demand estimates. The report from Marketing calmed him down momentarily, but still he cannot let go of the idea of the demand estimates being off.\n",

    "To address the uncertainty in demand, he wants you to assume demands at the Sales Regions are normally distributed with a CV of 0.1. In particular, he wants you to run a number of scenarios based on realizations from these normal distributions.\n",
