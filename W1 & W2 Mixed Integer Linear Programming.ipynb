    "GoClean&Co (GCC) hired you as its Logistics Manager in charge of transshipments. GoClean&Co is a joint public-private energy company dedicated to generating clean and safe nuclear energy. GCC uses a new technology based on radioactive pellets. These pellets can generate electricity for years in GCC's nuclear plants. Once the radioactive pellets are depleted, they are removed from active use and collected at the plants for removal at the end of the month. Once a month, the depleted pellets are removed from the plants, transported to an inspection site for examination, and then moved again to a dedicated storage site for safekeeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been informed that two of GCC's nuclear plants, called Plant One and Plant Two, need to move out depleted pellets in the following amounts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Plant One wants to ship out up to 280 pellets per month\n",
    "\n",
    "Plant Two wants to ship out up to 360 pellets per month\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how many pellets these two plants want to ship out per month. However, the exact number of pellets that will actually be moved out from each plant depends on the space that is available at the dedicated storage sites that would ultimately receive them. GCC is mandated by law to move as many pellets out of the plants as the storage sites are able to receive. You have been informed that two of GCC's dedicated storage sites, called Storage X and Storage Y, are ready to receive depleted pellets from GCC's plants, in the following amounts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Storage X is ready to receive a total of 305 pellets per month\n",
    "\n",
    "Storage Y is ready to receive a total of 325 pellets per month\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the two plants want to ship out more pellets per month than the two storage sites can receive, you know that some pellets will have to stay in their plant of origin until a later time. This is not a problem, however, since every one of GCC's plants has the capacity to temporarily store whatever pellets are not shipped out, and the law allows this.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this time, only one inspection site is available to receive the pellets from the two plants, inspect them, and send them out to the two storage sites. It is called Inspection Site A. Notice that inspection sites do not have storage capacity: the pellets come in, are inspected, and continue their trip to the storage sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving radioactive material is not easy and therefore it is not cheap either. There is a lot of planning and security involved. Each shipment of pellets has to be closely monitored and protected to prevent the loss of radioactive material. Also, the vehicles transporting the material have to move relatively slowly, to avoid accidents. Therefore, it is very expensive to transport the radioactive pellets from the plant to the inspection site, and from there to the storage site. Based on estimates and historical data, GCC has calculated the following transportation costs, in dollars per pellet moved:\n",
    "\n",
    "It costs 13.58 dollars to move one pellet from Plant One to Inspection Site A\n",
    "\n",
    "It costs 16.54 dollars to move one pellet from Plant Two to Inspection Site A\n",
    "\n",
    "It costs 7.57 dollars to move one pellet from Inspection Site A to Storage X\n",
    "\n",
    "It costs 16.46 dollars to move one pellet from Inspection Site A to Storage Y\n",
    "\n",
    "You decide to optimize the transhipment of depleted pellets from the plants to the storage sites (stopping on the way at Inspection Site A, of course) in order to minimize the overall monthly transportation cost. In this optimized solution, how many pellets will Plant Two be able to ship out to the Inspection Site A every month? (This question is not graded)."

    "You decide to estimate the distance of distributing the notebooks from a DC in one of a set of selected cities to the school children in another city. Given that you only need a quick and dirty estimate, you assume an Euclidean space and a circuity factor of 1.25, which gives you the distances in the table below (where cities are identified using the first three letters in their name). Regardless of which city the DC is located in, there will also be transportation from the DC to the school children within that same city. For distances inside each city, you assume 5 distance units, except for Mexico City, for which you use 10 distance units since it is a larger city.\n",

The plan would be to distribute all the hundreds of thousands of notebooks through these two DCs, using trucks. Let's assume that the cost of opening and operating such a DC in any of these cities would be the about the same, and that the cost of outbound transportation from the DC to the cities is about the same on a per unit per mile basis.\n",

They have found one contract manufacturer that meets their requirements. This contractor can provide the cups at 50dollars per thousand cups and has the capacity to provide 200 thousand cups per week. This is more expensive than the 10dollars per thousand cups of producing in-house, but because the contractor is located closer to the two DCs than Cocup's plant is, it will lead to more production capacity closer to the DCs.\n",

Cocup has one (1) manufacturing plant and two (2) Distribution Centers (DCs), as well as eight (8) regional sales offices (SOs) with warehouses on site. Paper cups are made at the plant and shipped by external carriers through the DCs to the sales offices.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may remember, the manufacturing plant is operating close to its capacity of 1,250 thousand cups per week. Because of this, Cocup has started to investigate if they should use a contract manufacturer. They have found one contract manufacturer that met their requirements. This contractor can provide the cups at 50dollar per thousand cups and has the capacity to provide 200 thousand cups per week. This is more expensive than the 10dollar per thousand cups of producing in-house, but because the contractor is located closer to the two DCs than Cocup's plant is, it will lead to more production capacity closer to the DCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cocup has also started to investigate whether they should rent space from a third party's distribution center to support the sales offices. They are considering three (3) more DCs, to add to the two (2) DCs they already have in their network. Transportation costs are 1$ per thousand cups and mile, for both inbound and outbound transportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may remember, the logistics manager of Cocup was skeptical about the demand estimates. The report from Marketing calmed him down momentarily, but still he cannot let go of the idea of the demand estimates being off.\n",

    "The first two statements are true. By increasing the required level of service, we are forcing the model to solve the impossible. Notice the number of barrels that are being delivered to Worcester (390 per week when only 190 are demanded) and Nashua (190 per week when only 140 are demanded). Why is this happening? Well, recall that we set the demand constraints to be greater than or equal to the minimum demand. In most cases, we will not exceed the minimum since we are charged for this in the objective function. In this case, though, the only way the model can satisfy the LOS constraint is to \"over-serve\" Worcester and Nashua in order to increase the percentage of customers within 50 miles of a DC! Suppose you changed the constraint to be equal to instead of greater than or equal to. Go ahead, try it. I'll wait.\n",

    "\n",
    "Increasing the capacity of the WO DC does nothing. You are not using current capacity, adding more does not shift volume from the other DCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing the capacity of the NA DC does a little - diverting just 10 barrels per week through the NA DC. Savings is about $18 per week. Not really a game changer, eh?\n",

    "Reducing the Bellows Falls costs from $2 to $1.75 a barrel will decrease costs by about $125 per week - not a real game changer either.\n",

    "You should have had an idea that this is the area to focus on by looking at the cost buckets in cells B4:B8. Notice that the largest costs are outbound transportation - this is the local delivery by the courier.\n",

    "The NERD CEO lives in Boston. She really, really wants to locate the DC there. But, she understands that it has to make economic sense and wants to understand how much more expensive Boston is than the other locations for a DC. Currently, Boston is not selected to open in the optimal solution (when allowing any number of DCs). Specifically, she is targeting the weekly fixed costs (cell C12). These are the labor, electricity, and other weekly costs that are pretty much independent of the flow through the facility.\n",

    "What does the Fixed Cost (cell C12) for the Boston DC need to be so that it becomes economically justifiable to open? That is, at what cost will the Boston DC enter the optimal solution? Enter your answer in dollars with no commas or currency symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Explanation</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The fixed cost needs to be lowered to about 9,660dollars in order for the Boston DC to enter the solution. How did we find that? Trial and error. It was originally 11k (Boston out of solution) so I tried 7k (Boston in!). Then I kept cutting the difference in half, e.g. 9k (in), 10k (out), 9.5k (in), etc. until I found the breakpoint of 9.66k. I allowed a pretty wide range here - I did not want you to calculate it to the penny.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this valuable? Well, we just used the model to estimate the value of a move that the model would not have considered. Lowering the fixed cost from 11,000dollars to 9,660dollars per week might be an easy thing to do or something really hard. We don't know - but the executives at NERD probably do! The model has given them a target cost to consider. Management might be willing to pay a little more for this for some reasons that the model does not consider as well. That is why the humans need to make the final decision - and not let the model do it!"

Wholesaler 1 charges 25dollars per box to supply Store 1, but adds a surcharge at 1dollar per box to supply Store 2 (for a total of 26dollar per box) because Store 2 does not permit back room loading by hand lift. Wholesaler 2 charges 25.50dollar per box regardless of the store. Each wholesaler has the capacity to deliver 50 boxes per week to the stores.\n",

    "Now, a manager at Fruity Juice has been given the option to source directly from a Boston-area distributor at $20 per box. However, in order to get the bananas at the lower price they have to be picked up at the warehouse by Fruity Juice. For this they can use the company van, which only fits 10 boxes. The van would be available for this trip only once a week.\n",

    "<h3>MicroMasters Practice Problem 5: Inventory Considerations at SandyCo</h3>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Remember where we left SandyCo in Week 1? They had just invested in a packaging machine at Plant 2 when they suffered a whimsical breakdown in one of the distribution centers and had to re-plan the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "SandyCo managed to make it through the breakdown, thanks to swift execution of the new plans, and their operations are now back to normal. However, they are interested in exploring how inventory costs could be proxied into their supply chain network design for the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us recap. SandyCo is a sand distributor who has two (2) facilities that mine, clean, and sort sand for use in cement, children’s playboxes, and small beaches. They distribute the sand from their two (2) plants, through two (2) packaging centers (DCs), to three (3) different customer regions where it is sold. They also have a packaging machine at Plant 2, so Plant 2 can supply Region 1 directly, without going through the DCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each plant has a specific maximum weekly supply of available sand and each region has an expected minimum weekly required demand. The cost to distribute a ton of sand differs between each plant and region pairing due to distance and other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum weekly supply from Plant 1 is 100, from Plant 2 it is 125. The expected minimum weekly required demand (tons) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Region 1: 25\n",
    "    \n",
    "Region 2: 95\n",
    "    \n",
    "Region 3: 80\n",
    "    \n",
    "The transportation costs per ton of sand are given in the table below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"w2supp51.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Part 2</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "SandyCo uses an inventory holding cost of $5 per ton sand and week. Use this and your linear approximation from Part 1 to update the previous optimization model to account for inventory costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the optimization model, what is the total cost of the current network when inventory costs are included? No optimization is needed, only include the extra cost. Answer in dollars without the dollar sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Part 3</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "There is plenty of capacity in both distribution centers still, so SandCo wants to explore what the cost would be of using only one DC.\n",
    "\n",
    "When inventory costs are taken into account, what is the difference in cost of using only DC A compared to using both DCs? Answer in dollars without the dollar sign. For instance, if your total cost from (Part 2) is 65,000 and you get a cost of 66,000, your answer is 65,000-66,000=-1000 (note the minus sign)."

    "Located next to SandyCo's DC A is third party logistics provider's DC. The third party can provide the same services as performed by SandyCo at their own DC. Since much of the inventory costs at DC A is due to handling, SandyCo is thinking about using the third party to reduce inventory costs. Instead of 5dollars per ton and week, the inventory holding cost with the third party DC would by 2dollars per ton. On the other hand, SandyCo would have to pay 2dollars per ton going through the third party's DC. Assume Plant 2 cannot supply Region 1 directly.\n",

    "With this third DC-option in the network - what is the cost-optimal combination of DCs in the network, considering transportation as well as inventory holding costs?\n",

    "<b>Explanation</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, this is to show that even though inventory costs are not normally used in these types of models -- for several reasons -- it is possible to estimate them and include them into the supply chain network model. However, as you see in this problem, even a very small problem becomes quite complicated pretty fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many things to consider in this setup, so an Excel file is provided below. Note that there are many other ways to model the problem in Excel, the spreadsheet shows one way, chosen for its relative clarity. The key points are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The decision variables: we need to include binary variables for each segment at each DC to calculate the total costs. A simple way to handle the rest of the model is to consider the segments as \"separate\" DCs (but with similar costs), and introduce decision variables for each such DC. That is, for every arc in the previous model we will have four arcs, one for each segment. We then introduce constraints to make sure that not more than one of the four arcs are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The objective function: This needs to be modified to include not just transportation costs as before, but inventory costs. To avoid problems with the solver, the linear approximation should be entered in two components - the \"constant\" which is multiplied by the binary variable indicating if a segment is \"on\"; and the \"slope\" which is multiplied by the throughput. Both components are multiplied by the holding cost (make sure you use the right cost for the different facilities!). For the third party, there is also a variable cost based only on throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constraints: We need supply, demand, conservation of flow (balance), and linking constraints as before. We also need to make sure that the binary variables are binary and that the sum of the binary variables is not more than 1 for each DC."
