Some of the channels get the goods directly from the CDC but it also has two intermediary depots to reach all the channels on time and also keep up with the demand.

You have the following data provided to you about the capacities of depots, costs and quantities demanded at the various channels.\n",

    "    \n",
    "Consider again AB Mower from this week's Practice Problem 1. After having met with both the logistics manager and the sales manager, the planner has some further analyses she likes to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "We pick up where we left AB Mower: overtime costs are SEK 220 per hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Part 1</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Your last analysis showed that the sales manager's suggestion to run a promotion in Month 9, at a 10% discount, was not profitable. The sales manager has told the planner that, respectfully, he disagrees. The sales team has run the numbers he says, and finds that it is, indeed, profitable. He shows you and the planner using your model: by changing the price in Month 9 to 5,400 the corresponding demand increases to 4,340 - for an increase in profit by more than SEK 7,000,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the problem with this solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "answer: In this question, what sales do is just apply 10% discount in month 9 without running the solver. So, you will see that although profit increases after manipulating the model, there are negative inventory in the inventory column which are not included into the calculation of cost of stock out, making the profitability inflate. However, after you run the solver, the negative inventory will convert to backlogged as the model is set up based on the logic that inventory is non-negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Part 2</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The sales manager buys your argument. He still thinks you should run a promotion at the end of the season to get the last demand before the fall comes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If AB Mower was to launch a promotion in Month 9, what is the optimal discount? Answer in full percent, without the percentage symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no simple way to include this in the model without running into non-linearity problems. We could however do a quick check by running the model for a few different values. Pretty quickly we see that the profit is maximized at a 2% discount -- not a whole lot of discount.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Part 3</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "As the new year is approaching, you hear from one of the purchasers that a new outsourcing option has appeared, that could produce the lawn mower at only SEK 5,000 per unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the promotion from Part 2 will run in Month 9, what is the optimal amount to outsource, in total?\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Part 4</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before finalizing the plan, the planner tells you that he has heard from engineering that the plant needs to be down one of the months next year for scheduled maintenance. The outsourcing option from Part 3 still applies, as well as the promotion from Part 2.\n",
    "\n",
